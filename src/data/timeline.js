		title: 'Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning [eCornell]',
		duration: '1 year',
		details:
			'Using python, I implemented k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, regression trees, and a variety of machine learning algorithms with practice selecting the best model, considering key principles of how to implement those models effectively. I had the opportunity to implement algorithms on live data while practicing debugging and improving models through approaches such as ensemble methods and support vector machines, as well as the inner workings of neural networks and how to construct and adapt neural networks for various types of data.',

		title: 'First Line of Code',
		duration: 'the beginning',
		details:
			"I wrote my first line of real code that started this journey into digital craftsmanship that I never could've imagined, especially as someone who never saw themselves as anything other than a blue collar worker.",
